            Fractals are one of mathematics more beautiful aspects and they appear
            everywhere in nature as well from the bark on a rough tree to the structure
            of it's branches and it's leaves, in the way clouds form and dirt cracks
            due to drought, how snowflakes form like fractals and many other naturally
            occuring instances. It was Bernoit Mandelbrot who first discovered the
            fractals and later a perticularly famous fractal, namely the Mandelbrot
            set, has been named after him to honor discovery.

            Fractals are also useful in calculating a sort of roughness, this being
            useful in dealing with the structure of coastlines, for example in the
            case that potential ships were to sail alongside it, it would be smart
            to first figure out if that is a good idea due to potential shipwreckage.
